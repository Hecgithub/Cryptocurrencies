# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The cryptocurrency market has been a vibrant environment with many unknowns about how it fluctuates. Using UML in this project, data will be processed, clustered, have dimensions reduced, and reduce the principal components using PCA. In doing so, a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio will be established for customers in investment banking. The analysis will include a deeper understanding of which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investments.  The data will be processed in a machine learning  model. 

## Results 

•	The first few steps were to process the data for PCA. Below is a snapshot of the cleaned data frame.

•	A data frame with the three principle components is then created.

•	The Elbow Crypto elbow curve then displays the optimal number of clusters which is 4.

•	A 3D scatter plot helps visualize the clusters.

•	The table with tradable cryptocurrencies can be seen below. There are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies.

•	Lastly, a scatter plot was created to show the total coins mined and total coins supplied by class.

## Summary 
There are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies. The basis for an investment portfolio has been set up. Cryptocurrency has been set up into four classes.
